# LexiGuard Backend API 🛡️

This repository contains the backend service for **LexiGuard**, an AI-powered legal document analysis tool. Our mission is to democratize legal understanding by transforming dense, jargon-filled contracts into simple, actionable insights for everyone.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Legal documents—from rental agreements to terms of service—are often incomprehensible to the average person. This information gap creates significant risks, where individuals might agree to unfavorable terms without realizing it.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

The LexiGuard backend is a cloud-native API that serves as the "brain" of our application. It receives legal text, uses Google's powerful Gemini AI model to analyze it, and returns two key pieces of information:

1. **Plain-English Summary** of the document's purpose, terms, and obligations.  
2. **Risk Analysis** that flags potentially unfavorable or non-standard clauses, explained in simple terms.

## 🚀 Live API Endpoint

Our production API is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** and is available for the frontend to consume.

**Base URL:**
